# S.purp_MeDIP
scripts and files for JEMBE

# These scripts uses DESeq2 to analyze methylation counts of genes and promoters (1kb above gene region)
# These scripts also outputs files for GOMWU analysis (see https://github.com/z0on/GO_MWU) and DAPC

# note on naming scheme. Samples were initially labeled using (B) Blue: non-upwelling conditions (650 uatm, 17C); (R) Red: upwelling conditions (1330 uatm, 13C), with the first letter denoting the maternal environment and the second letter denoting the developmental environment (B: 450 uatm, R: 1050 uatm). The naming scheme was updated for the manuscript for clarity. BB=NL, BR=NH, RB=UL, RR=UH
